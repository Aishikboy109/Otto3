# Otto3
This is a very simple voice assistant that uses SpeechRecognizer.  
Use pip to install SpeechRecognizer. 

I had trouble with using SpeechRecognizer initially in Pycharm with Anaconda.  It
seems that one is better off using Pycharms bundled virtual env in general.
After I removed Anaconda from my system, it just worked.  

The "Say" program is added using sudo apt install.  It works very well.  
I'd be interested in seeing how to change the voice.

I haven't started working on commands yet.  So far, Otto3 can 
listen, convert speech to text, and use that text to fire off commands.

If this interests you, it's is a pretty good start for building a voice assistant.  
It's easy code to understand, although I'll probably add a bunch of comments next to make 
this an even easier base to add to.
